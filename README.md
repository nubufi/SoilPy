## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### Basic Foundation Analysis
```python
from soilpy.models import Foundation, SoilLayer, SoilProfile, Loads
from soilpy.bearing_capacity.vesic import calc_bearing_capacity

# Create a foundation
foundation = Foundation(
    foundation_depth=2.0,
    foundation_length=10.0,
    foundation_width=5.0
)

# Create soil layers
layers = [
    SoilLayer(
        thickness=2.0,
        dry_unit_weight=1.8,
        saturated_unit_weight=2.0,
        cu=50.0,
        phi_prime=30.0
    )
]

# Create soil profile
profile = SoilProfile(layers=layers, ground_water_level=1.5)

# Calculate bearing capacity
capacity = calc_bearing_capacity(foundation, profile, 100.0)  # 100 t/m¬≤ pressure
print(f"Bearing capacity: {capacity.ultimate_bearing_capacity} t/m¬≤")
```

### Settlement Analysis
```python
from soilpy.elastic_settlement.boussinesq import calc_elastic_settlement

# Calculate elastic settlement
settlement_result = calc_elastic_settlement(profile, foundation, 100.0)
print(f"Total settlement: {settlement_result.total_settlement} cm")
```

### SPT Data Analysis
```python
from soilpy.models.spt import NValue, SPT, SPTExp, SPTBlow
from soilpy.enums import SelectionMethod

# Create SPT data
spt_exp = SPTExp.new([], "Borehole-1")
spt_exp.add_blow(1.5, NValue(15))
spt_exp.add_blow(3.0, NValue(25))
spt_exp.add_blow(4.5, NValue(30))

# Create SPT collection
spt = SPT.new(1.2, 1.05, 0.9, SelectionMethod.AVG)
spt.add_exp(spt_exp)

# Get idealized experiment
idealized = spt.get_idealized_exp("Idealized")
print(f"Number of blows: {len(idealized.blows)}")
```
